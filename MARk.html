        <h3>WORK, ENERGY, POWER AND MACHINES
        </h3>
        <p>-In physics energy is very key to be studied in relation to work, power and machines. Matter is studied in relation to energy because it must possess energy in form of either potential or kinetic energy among others.<br>The study of energy enables us to use different sources of energy depending on source efficiency.<br>Energy can be defined as the ability to do work. It can also be defined as the difference between the energy absorbed or released and the work done by the machine.
            Work is the product of force and the distance moved by the load.<br>
            Work is the product of force and the distance moved by the load.<br>Work = force x distance<br> 
                 = FxD<br>
                 <h3> NATURAL SOURECS OF ENERGY</h3>
                 <P>1.	Sun-this is the main source of energy. Radiation from the sun makes it possible to generate electrical energy.<br>
                    2.	Wind- it is used in driving windmills for pumping water which thereafter generates electricity for different uses.<br> 
                    3.	Fuels- these are natural gases, wood and charcoal which produces energy for domestic use. Biogas serves as an alternate fuel  in this category.<br>
                    4.	Geothermal- underground hot water which gushes out in form of steam is used to turn turbines in geothermal power stations producing electricity e.g the olkaria geothermal power station near Nakuru.<br>
                    5.	Nuclear(atomic)P energy- nuclear fission which is produced as a result of interactions in the nucleus produces a lot of energy which can generate electricity.<br>The law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created or destroyed but it can only be converted from one form to another also called the first law of thermodynamics. 
                    <h3>RENEWABLE AND NON-RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES.</h3><br>Renewable sources are those that are inexhaustible while non-renewable sources are those energy sources whose supply is exhaustible in nature.<br>

Itâ€™s S.I unit is newton meter (NM)<h3>GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL ENERGY</h3><br>
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/trdMoCx-sq0?si=W8lM560j-lChtK-x">click here to see demonstration</a> <br> Gravitational potential energy is defined as the energy possessed by a body due to its state of relative position(at rest).
                         <br>In this case work done is equal to the potential energy gained in lifting an object through an height,h, 
                    P.E= mgh      where P.E- potential energy<br>
                                                      m- mass<br>
                                                       g- gravitational force<br>
                                                        h- height<br>
        <h3>ELASTIC POTENTIAL ENERGY</h3><br>This is the energy used in compressing or stretching  a spring which is equal to the energy stored in the spring. 
        <br>W=1/2Fe<br>EXAMPLE<br>A force of 7.5N stretches a certain spring by 5cm. how much work is done in stretching this spring by 8cm. <br>
        7.5N=5cm<br>
     ? =8cm<br>
=12N <br>W=FxD<br>
=12x0.08<br>
= 0.96NM<br><b>KINETIC ENERGY</b><br>This is the energy possessed by a body in motion. <br>
K.E= 1/2mv^2<br><b>POWER</b><br>This is the rate of doing work. The S.I  unit of power is the watt(W)<br>
Power =work done/time taken<br><b>MACHINES</b><br>These are devices that enables us to do work more conveniently and with ease. Examples of machines include; levers, pulleys, hydraulic press, gears, screw and inclined planes.<br>
<b>Definitions</b> <br><b>1.Effort</b>- it the force applied on the machine. (E)<br>
<b>2.Load</b>- is the force applied by the machine. ( L)<br><b>3.Mechanical advantage(M.A)</b>- is the ratio of load to the effort. 
<br>M.A = load/effort<br><b>EXAMPLE</b><br>A force of 30N is used to overcome a load of 120N. calculate the mechanical advantage. 
<br>M.A= 120/30<br>
       = 4<br>Mechanical advantage depends on:<br>1.	Friction between the moving parts
       <br>2.	Weight of body parts to be lifted<br><br><b>4.Velocity ratio</b><br>-Velocity ratio(V.R)
       This is the ratio of the effort distance to load distance<br>V.R= effort distance/load distance<br>
       <b>4.Efficiency</b> <br>This is the Ratio of work output to work input<br>It also the ratio of work done on the load to work done by the effort.<br>
       Work output = load x load distance <br>Work input = effort x effort distance<br>Efficiency =( work output/work input) x 100%<br>
       Also efficiency can be calculated as:<br>Efficiency =(M.A /V.R) X 100%<br><b>Factors reducing the efficiency</b><br>1.	Weight of body parts
       <br>2.	Friction force between the moving parts.<br><b>Example</b> <br>In a machine the load moves 2m the effort moves 8m. if an effort of 20N is used to raise a load of 60N. what is the efficiency of the machine. <br>
       Efficiency=(M.A)/(V.R)x100%<br>
M.A=Load/Effort<br>
       =60N/20N<br>
       =3<br>
V.R=(Effort distance )/(Load distance)<br>
      =8/2<br>
      =4<br>
      Therefore, Efficiency=3/4x100%<br>
      =75%<br>
      <b>Inclined plane</b> <br>-It easens the the loading of heavy laggauge onto the back of a lorry.
